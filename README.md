# C++ Utilities
Every C++ utility that I use in my projects.

## Notes
- Copyright notice of outside authors will be given with the respective file.
- Utility tools made by outside authors can be slightly modified by me.
- Utilities made by me will not contain a copyright notice because they will reflect the same copyright notice that the repository has.
- No compiled binaries, you will need to compile them by yourself but probability exists.
- No documentation for any utility tool, you will need to read comments and understand code to figure out what the respective utility tool does.
- Contributions to improve code are well appreciated.
- Keep calm & enjoy! ;)
